# Checkpoint Protocol

Save all session state so the next session resumes with minimal token cost.

## Trigger

User invokes `/jira-planner checkpoint` when ready to save session state.

## Save (Checkpoint)

Write in importance order (smallest first = fail-safe).

### Pre-check. Worktree verify (run before any write)

A checkpoint written to the wrong worktree is worse than no checkpoint — it corrupts state in a repo the user isn't thinking about. Always confirm location before writing.

```bash
pwd
git worktree list
git status --short --branch
```

Verify:
- `pwd` matches the intended project root for the active story
- Current branch matches the story's working branch (check MEMORY.md Shortcuts or `plan.md`)
- No uncommitted changes in paths unrelated to the checkpoint (MEMORY.md, status.md, nanotask files)

If any mismatch, STOP. Surface the discrepancy to the user and ask which worktree is the correct target. Do not write.

### Step 0. Validate (read before write)

Cross-check active files for consistency before saving. Read:
- `plan.md` — nanotask list, dependency chain, key decisions
- `status.md` — status table
- Active nanotask files (`WAO-{subtask}-{n}.md`) for pending/in-progress items only

Check for:
- **Duplication**: Same diff/modification described in multiple nanotask files
- **Stale terms**: Deprecated terminology (e.g., old system names) in active docs
- **Inconsistency**: status.md rows vs plan.md nanotask list (missing/extra items, status mismatch)
- **Scope drift**: Nanotask content that contradicts current Key Decisions

Fix issues inline before proceeding to save steps. If no issues found, proceed directly.

### Step 1. MEMORY.md (compact, then write)

Write first — auto-loads on next session, fail-safe if session crashes mid-checkpoint.

**MEMORY.md has exactly 3 sections. No other sections allowed:**

```markdown
# Context
active_story: {epic_key}/{story_key}

## Working Space
- Current epic/story summary (1-2 lines)
- Previous session summary (what was done, key findings, 3-5 lines max)

# Shortcuts
- Minimal paths for immediate codebase/doc access (table format)
- Only include paths that are actively referenced across sessions

# TODO
- Pending jobs with nanotask IDs
- Open questions that need resolution
- Do NOT include completed items or stable decisions
```

**MANDATORY:** The `active_story:` field MUST be present directly under `# Context`.
Format: `{epic_key}/{story_key}` (e.g., `WAO-303/WAO-310`).
This is parsed by `/jira-planner:onboarding` to locate the workspace directory.

**Compaction rules:**
- **Target:** Under 50 lines. Anything stable belongs in code/config, not memory.
- **Remove** anything already encoded in code, config files, or CLAUDE.md rules.
- **Remove** completed TODOs — they live in status.md.
- **Remove** session-specific details older than 1 session.
- **Never include** key decisions, patterns, project structure, CLI commands that don't change.

### Step 2. status.md

Edit single rows — no full rewrite needed.
Path: `$JIRA_PLANNER_SPACE_DIR/{epic-id}/{story-id}/status.md`

- Update Status column (`pending` → `in_progress` / `completed`)
- Add commit Hash for completed nanotasks
- Add Updated date
- Append new rows if nanotasks were added via Amend

### Step 3. CC Tasks (compact, then sync)

**Compaction first — remove noise, keep only actionable tasks:**

```text
1. TaskList() — read current state
2. FOR EACH completed task older than current subtask:
   TaskUpdate(status=deleted)  — historical record lives in status.md, not CC Tasks
3. FOR EACH task not in status.md (stale from prior Stories):
   TaskUpdate(status=deleted)
4. Result: CC Tasks contains only pending + in_progress + current subtask's completed
```

**Then sync remaining tasks to match status.md:**

- Completed (current subtask) → `TaskUpdate` status=completed
- In-progress → `TaskUpdate` with Progress block:

```text
## Progress
- In progress: [current work + exact resume point]
- Next: [exact next action]
```

- Pending → leave as-is
- Reopened → `TaskUpdate` status=in_progress, append follow-up context

## Restore (New Session)

Read in breadth order (summary first → detail).

1. MEMORY.md — auto-loaded in system prompt (resume context)
2. `TaskList` → 2-level hierarchy (subtask groups + nanotask work items)
3. `status.md` → current nanotask statuses
4. `plan.md` → blueprint context if needed (objectives, decisions)
5. **Prior artifacts** — for the target nanotask, read completed nanotasks in the same subtask (their plan files, reports/, blueprint/) to avoid re-investigating already documented findings
6. Resume from first pending/in-progress nanotask
